TODO List:
- ~~Pipeline with, standardisation, normalisation, and maybe imputer, howwever we have already done this code ourself~~
- ~~Train test split~~
- ~~Linear regression model~~
- ~~ridge regression model~~
- ~~lasso regression model~~
- ~~elastic net regression model~~
- ~~polynomial regression model with regularisation~~
- ~~compare performance between all models and select best 2 model~~
- evaluate 2 best models on test set
- go through comments/explanation of code, make sure it all makes sense!

NOTES FOR SONNY:
- removed first graph/chart, do we need it if we can't explain it?
- same for scatter graph?
- could we go through where you compare performance and select the 2 best models so I can get a better idea of what we are looking at, a bit confused on the last part
